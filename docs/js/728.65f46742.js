However, real-world clinical practices vary across hospitals and institutions, resulting in different data modalities and task formulations. As a result, there is increasing attention toward developing a general model that can effectively handle various medical scenarios. Such a model, with excellent generalization ability to process different medical image modalities and perform a variety of medical AI tasks, is commonly referred to as a general medical AI. Inspired by recent advances in the generalization power of large-scale vision-language and foundation models in computer vision, this first workshop on foundation models for general medical AI (MedAGI) is dedicated to addressing the current medical AI systems and discussing opportunities for generalizing learning systems across multiple unseen tasks and domains specifically targeting various medical data (e.g., images, omics, clinical data) processing and analysis scenarios. </div></div><div id="topics" data-v-c2dfb3e8><h2 data-v-c2dfb3e8>Topics</h2><hr data-v-c2dfb3e8><div id="topic-description" data-v-c2dfb3e8> Topics are included but not limited to: </div><ul id="topic-list" data-v-c2dfb3e8><li data-v-c2dfb3e8>AGI, Foundation models, and multi-purpose models for medical data</li><li data-v-c2dfb3e8>Benchmarks for general medical AI</li><li data-v-c2dfb3e8>Zero/few-shot, self-/weak-supervised learning</li><li data-v-c2dfb3e8>Domain generalization and adaptation</li><li data-v-c2dfb3e8>Pre-training, fine-tuning, prompt tuning</li><li data-v-c2dfb3e8>Open-vocabulary object detection, segmentation</li><li data-v-c2dfb3e8>Multitask learning, knowledge distillation, pseudo labeling</li><li data-v-c2dfb3e8>Current challenges and/or future trends in general medical AI</li><li data-v-c2dfb3e8>Social impact and/or ethical issues of general medical AI</li></ul></div><div id="important-dates" data-v-c2dfb3e8><h2 data-v-c2dfb3e8>Important Dates</h2><hr data-v-c2dfb3e8><div id="dates-table" data-v-c2dfb3e8><div class="date-row" data-v-c2dfb3e8><div class="dates" data-v-c2dfb3e8>June 25, 2023 (23:59 PDT)</div><div class="due-work" data-v-c2dfb3e8>Paper submission due</div></div><div class="date-row" data-v-c2dfb3e8><div class="dates" data-v-c2dfb3e8>July 30, 2023</div><div class="due-work" data-v-c2dfb3e8>Notification of paper decisions</div></div><div class="date-row" data-v-c2dfb3e8><div class="dates" data-v-c2dfb3e8>August 13, 2023</div><div class="due-work" data-v-c2dfb3e8>Camera ready papers due</div></div><div class="date-row" data-v-c2dfb3e8><div class="dates" data-v-c2dfb3e8>September 6, 2023</div><div class="due-work" data-v-c2dfb3e8>Workshop proceedings due</div></div><div class="date-row" data-v-c2dfb3e8><div class="dates" data-v-c2dfb3e8>October 12, 2023</div><div class="due-work" data-v-c2dfb3e8>Workshop date</div></div></div></div><div id="instructions" data-v-c2dfb3e8><h2 data-v-c2dfb3e8>Submission Instructions</h2><hr data-v-c2dfb3e8><div data-v-c2dfb3e8><div class="instruction-contents" data-v-c2dfb3e8><strong data-v-c2dfb3e8>Submission format |</strong> Submissions are in two tracks: Full-length papers and extended abstracts. <ol data-v-c2dfb3e8><li data-v-c2dfb3e8> Full-length papers: Manuscripts should be up to <b data-v-c2dfb3e8>8 pages</b> (text, figures, and tables) plus up to <b data-v-c2dfb3e8>2 pages</b> of references.
