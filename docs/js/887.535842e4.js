Trained in flexible manner on large and diverse datasets, foundation models offer unprecedented generalization ability, and if leveraged correctly, broad utility. In this talk, I will first paint a picture of how foundation models may set us off on a trajectory towards the next iPhone moment in MICCAI. I will then substantiate this by providing recent examples of how we develop and use foundation models to tame perpetually challenging problems across MICCAI, concluding with an elaborate discussion of open challenges and opportunities.
