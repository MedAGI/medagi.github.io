Trained in flexible manner on large and diverse datasets, foundation models offer unprecedented generalization ability, and if leveraged correctly, broad utility. In this talk, I will first paint a picture of how foundation models may set us off on a trajectory towards the next iPhone moment in MICCAI. I will then substantiate this by providing recent examples of how we develop and use foundation models to tame perpetually challenging problems across MICCAI, concluding with an elaborate discussion of open challenges and opportunities. <br data-v-2e58d05e><b data-v-2e58d05e>Bio.</b> Mathias Unberath is the John C. Malone Associate Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, core faculty in the Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare and the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics, and affiliate faculty in the Institute for Assured Autonomy. He holds secondary appointments in the School of Medicine. With his team, the ARCADE research group on Advanced Robotics and Computationally AugmenteD Environments, he builds the future of computer-assisted medicine. Through synergistic research on imaging, computer vision, machine learning, and interaction design, they create human-centered solutions that are embodied in emerging technology such as mixed reality and robotics. Mathias has published more than 175 journal and conference articles, and has received numerous awards, grants, and fellowships, including the NSF Career, NIH NIBIB R21 Trailblazer and Google Research Scholar Award, and more than 20 international paper awards. </div></div></div></div>',1),g=[f];function p(e,a,i,n,d,s){return(0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)("div",l,[c,"2023"===s.currentYear?((0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)("div",h,u)):((0,t.uX)(),(0,t.CE)("div",m,g))])}var y={computed:{currentYear(){return this.$route.params.year||(new Date).getFullYear().toString()}},methods:{fetchData(){this.currentYear}},created(){this.fetchData()}},b=i(1241);const C=(0,b.A)(y,[["render",p],["__scopeId","data-v-2e58d05e"]]);var I=C}}]);
